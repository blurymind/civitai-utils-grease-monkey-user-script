# civitai-utils-grease-monkey-user-script
Tiny user script for greasemonkey or tampermonkey that adds some extra buttons to civitai.com


# features
- Copy all visible image and video src links on the visible portion of the page. This is a bit limited since the website virtualizes its gallery - it can only copy the mounted elements. This is a useful one to use with something like jdownloader which listens to your clipboard getting links and downloads them
